		<h2>gpsNav App Demo Page</h2>
		<p>This page is to show how the app can be used.  Before using the app, the following HTML must be pasted somewhere on your webpage/app:</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;img src="placeholder.jpg" id="map" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="error"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>The following link to the script must also be pasted:</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;script src="gpsNav.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>To initialize/activate the app, simply paste this script after <code>gpsNav.js</code>:</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;gpsNav.init();&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>If you want to add your own custom settings (such as changing the size of the map), please read <code>README.md</code> to learn more.</p>
